## Founding religion

Town leader can order a construction of a temple. On order, he must also set priest for temple and religion metadata. When temple is finished, priest becomes religion leader. In temple he has options to write canon law. When he finishes the process, the religion is created.

### Choosing dogma

Upon creation, church leader must define dogma for his church:

* Religious group (christianty, islam, judaism)
* Sets relations toward other religions
* Organization: centralized / decentralized
* Relations to rulership: demand coronation or not
* Leader selection: everyone / clergy only / electoral college
* Excommunication: leader can excommunicate or not

#### Religious group

More of a roleplay option

#### Relations with other religions

Leader can set which religions get along (for example russian orthodox and serbian orthodox) and which not.

#### Centralization / decentralization

If a church is centralized, all appointments and constructions are made by church leader.

In decentralized church each player can build a temple and then become priest of it. By upgrading it (temple -> cathedral) he can get higher rank.

#### Relation to rulership

If leader sets coronation to mandatory, then non-coronated leader belonging to religion cannot form duchy/kingdom/empire without being coronated first. He also cannot become duke/king/emperor without coronation.

#### Leader selection

Leader selection is always done by vote. Leader can select whether election is done by all followers, all clergymen or by those he appoints as electorates (electorate can only be given, not revoked, except in case of excommunication).

#### Excommunication

If a player is excommunicated, religion still shows on his profile, but he is locked out of all actions retaining religion. If excommunicated player is priest or elector, he loses those positions. Leader can reconcile player.

## De facto and de jure town religion

Each town has a de jure religion and de facto religion. De facto religion is set by town leader. All new players born into this town, get a de jure religion. De facto religion is religion of majority of inhabitants.

If de jure and de facto religions don't match, certain maluses are applied (TODO)

## Piety

Church earns score called piety, which can be used to change dogma (accumulates up to 100 piety, changing one dogma cost 100 piety).

## Holy war

Church leader can declare holy war on single town. This forms army in temple location. Army then moves toward target. Every follower can join the army on its way. If holy army wins, de jure religion is changed and hostile temples are destroyed (specified by church leader). After de jure is changed, it cannot be changed for some time. 

Winning holy war grants piety.
