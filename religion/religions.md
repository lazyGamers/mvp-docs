# Religions

## Churches

List of churches:
* Catholic church
* Islam
* Orthodox church (separated into Serbian, Bulgarian, Constantinople, Russian + some more??)

## Player's religion
At beginning player gets religion of the province he is born in. Later religion can be changed by being baptised by a priest.

## Organization

Church is lead by head of religion, elected by electors.

Next level is bishop, who owns cathedral in a [bishopry](https://github.com/lazyGamers/mvp-docs/blob/master/kingdoms/towns.md#bishopry). He is appointed by head of religion.

Lowest level is priest, who owns church. He is appointed by bishop of connected bishopry. Head can change connected bishopry.

Elector is special status granted by head of religion (limit to bishop?) and can vote in the next elections for religious head. (example cardinal for catholic).

### Leader election
If there is no leader, the elections are triggered. The only people who can vote are the electors and they can only vote for one of the other electors (not himself). There is only one round and in case of tie, it goes in favor of senior player.

## Territory

Each province has a designated religion. Clergy can control only provinces of same religion.

### Changing religion of province
It is possible to change religion of province in multiple ways:

* Bishop belonging to kingdom owner can convert the province by performing an action
* The province can be cleansed of heresy by crusading army. If army wins battle in province, then province is converted.
