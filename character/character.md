# Character

## Identity
Player on creation chooses unique combination of first and last name. Supported are only latin characters (with extended support for special characters - čžšćđ...).

## Skills

More info on [skills page](https://github.com/lazyGamers/mvp-docs/blob/master/character/skills.md).

## Health, death, food

Death will be impossible, player will only pass out for a number of hours. Each player has 100 HP max. Some diseases can lower max HP until they are cured. Player needs to eat food, otherwise he loses HP. When HP drops under certain level he gets 'famished' trait which reduces his abilities. This is to create incentive for food, so ideally you would eat it constantly, but also prevents losing players due to badly timed absence from game (with 0 food and 10 HP and 3 days of absence) - higher retaining.

In a battle a player is not killed, only knocked unconscious and he passes out for some hours. (however, he is out of that war - more on [war section](../war/army.md#dying-in-battle) section

### Diseases

A player can get a high number of diseases or injuries. For example broken foot lowers travelling speed by a large factor. Broken arm reduces strength, fleshwound reduces hp every day until cured, flu reduces max hp, etc. Healing can be done by certain role (priests?)

## Inventory

Player can carry only a certain weight of items.

Money is not part of inventory and cannot be stored anywhere. (idea for bank?)
