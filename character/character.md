# Character

## Identity
Player on creation chooses unique combination of first and last name. Supported are only latin characters (with extended support for special characters).

## Skills

More info on [skills page](https://github.com/lazyGamers/mvp-docs/blob/master/character/skills.md).

## Inventory

Player can carry only a certain weight of items.

Money is not part of inventory and cannot be stored anywhere. (idea for bank?)
