# War

In order to attack or defend, a player must join an army. Armies are raised during war and disbanded in peace.

## Raising army

Each town can raise its own armies. Town leader can create army and set a leader for it. Each army is created inside town and all recruitment is done inside town. Player can only join his town's army. Army can only be raised when war is declared.

## Combining armies

If there are two armies of same town, they can be combined into single army. If there are two armies belonging to same kingdom, they can be combined into royal army (same for duchies & empires).

## Disbanding armies

When army owner (town, kingdom,..) is not at war anymore, the army is automatically disbanded.

## Moving armies

Armies can be moved only by their commanders, from town to town (also through unclaimed lands).

## Army camp

Regular player that joins army has no influence on the army moves and he travels within the army. However, to keep him busy, he has some options he can do while travelling (inside army camp): training, crafting, ... - so that he is not bored.

## Types of battle

If two opposing armies meet on unclaimed land or in neutral town it is open-field battle. Otherwise it is siege.

## Dying in battle

A player that dies in battle, is thrown out of army and passes out for X hours. When he recovers, he cannot rejoin the army, meaning he is out of the war. However, if he wishes to reenter the fight, he needs to return to his own town and join new army there and travel back with new army to war zone. (Many times this will mean you won't be able to replenish very fast, to simulate war casualties).

## Navy

Navy works same as army, except that smallest army unit is a ship (which needs to be built first). Instead of unclaimed land you have open sea, siege is port blockade. Navy occupying sea node means enemy players cannot travel over that node.

If army wants to move over sea, it needs navy (army needs to merge with fleet - this is not full merge like army-to-army)

If a player dies in sea battle, he passes out and is thrown to random near coastal town.

## Mercenaries

Mercenaries operate like army, with specialties - TODO
