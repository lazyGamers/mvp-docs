A judge is appointed by town leader.

Any player can open a criminal procedure at court against someone. 

A judge passes verdict and sets punishment.

## Punishment

* Fine (money, items)
* Prison time
* confiscation of property
* banishment

Each player can at the moment procedure is opened chose his attitude to case. He can choose between 'defiant' or 'cooperative'. Cooperative is set as default. This has no effect during trial, but after, if player was recognized as guilty.

### Prison punishment

#### Arrest

If judge sets prison punishment, then player must be arrested by guards. If he is on cooperative attitude, then on arrest he moves to prison. In defiant attitude, player tries to fight a guard and if he fails, he moves to prison. If he succeeds, he remains free (until the next meeting with guards)

#### Prison time

In prison, a player still have some options to do (workout, perform prison labour, ...)

### Fine punishment

A criminal is given some time to pay the fine. If fine is not delivered in time, he can be jailed (judge must specify this when setting punishment (on forum and in courthouse)).

### Property confiscation

Property can be confiscated by guard. Judge must specify exactly which properties will be confiscated when setting punishment (and only in same town as judge). If criminal is in cooperative mode, his property is confiscated. If he is in defiant mode, guard must fight him to confiscate it (if criminal is not present in town, no fight needed for confiscation.). If he defends property, there is cooldown (2 weeks?) until guards can try to confiscate it again.

## Laws

A law can be anything, but it must not be ambigous. Punishment and target must be clearly specified. 

## Trial

Trial is started from courthouse, and is auto-created on forum, but all subsequent communication is done on forum.

Judge can pronounce verdict only based on laws, existing before crime was commited.
